This repository contains the source code for the SCGraphTheory.Search NuGet package, as well as its tests and performance benchmarks.
It also contains some test-focused graph implementations, which are used in the tests and performance benchmarks. 

## Package Documentation

For documentation of the package itself, see https://sdcondon.net/SCGraphTheory/search.

## Source Documentation

I have not written up any documentation of the source (e.g. repo summary, design discussion, build guidance) - and likely won't unless someone else expresses an interest in contributing.
Once cloned, it should "just work" as far as compilation is concerned.

## Issues and Contributions

I'm not expecting anyone to want to get involved given the low download figures on NuGet, but please feel free to do so.
I do keep an eye on the [issues](https://github.com/sdcondon/SCGraphTheory.Search/issues) tab, and will add a CONTRIBUTING.md if anyone drops me a message expressing interest.
